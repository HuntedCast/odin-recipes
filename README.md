This project is to build and demonstrate basic HTML skills learned through the Odin Project first few lessons.

In this project, I have demonstrated my ability to create very basic HTML pages featuring the following things:
- HTML Boilerplate
- Headers, paragraphs, images, ordered/unordered lists and links
- Proper attributes within HTML tags
